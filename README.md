# CS100.1x
My solution to edX CS100.1x course on Big Data using Apache Spark by University of Berkeley

This solution should only be referenced if you are not bound by any honor code and copying or duplication of this code is strictly prohibited.

It should just be used as a reference material.
The repositories consist of all the files provided by BerkeleyX and only the required .pynb file should be uploaded to the vagrant environment(or jupyter). This course uses sparkVM to run the program.
